				About Monica
			</h1>
			<p class="subtext editable">
				Monica Chew is a Bay Area pianist. I founded Minsky Duo with Nato, and Duo Moderna with Jerry Kuderna. I prefer chamber music to concerti, Haydn to Mozart, and lately Bartok above all things. My favorite thing is to produce concerts with a strong narrative arc.<br /><br />Previously, I worked as a software engineer at Mozilla and Google.
