				About Monica
			</h1>
			<p class="subtext editable">
				Monica Chew is an Oakland pianist. In 2017 she released her first solo album, Tender and Strange, featuring works by Bart&oacute;k, Jan&aacute;ƒçek, Messiaen, Takemitsu, and Scriabin. A &ldquo;gifted player with an affinity for deeply sensitive expression&rdquo; (Whole Note), her playing is &ldquo;wonderfully delicate, like tissue&rdquo; (International Pianist). She has been a featured artist on KPFA and radio stations across the United States. She started composing in 2017 and couldn&rsquo;t be happier about it. She premiered her first songs for soprano and piano in 2018 and completed her first commission for Left Coast Chamber Ensemble&rsquo;s Intersection 2019 workshop. She loves playing chamber music and received a Zellerbach Family Foundation award for her chamber music work. Prior to 2015, she neglected piano for nearly a decade to work as a principal software engineer on security and privacy at Mozilla and Google after receiving her Master of Music from SF Conservatory of Music and a PhD in computer science from UC Berkeley. She lives in Oakland with her husband, an 1899 Steinway B, a clavichord, and a disused violin.
